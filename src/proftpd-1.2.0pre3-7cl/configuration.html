        unix FTP daemons</strong>, which requires the daemon to
        retain root privileges even after a client has fully
        authenticated. In proftpd versions 1.0.x, we chose to
        ignore RFC959's port 20 requirements in the interests of
        security. Unfortunately, over time, it became obvious
        that this was a bad idea. Until the RFC is
        &quot;fixed&quot;, this problem will continue to plague
        unix FTP servers.<br>
        <br>
        In proftpd versions 1.1.x and higher, we chose to go the
        &quot;standard&quot; route, retaining root at all times,
        allowing the daemon to bind to port 20 and be completely
        RFC959 compliant. The security issue remains, however the
        code is carefully structured to handle this in as secure
        a fashion as possible.<br>
        <br>
        You have two options for working around this problem:<br>
        <br>
        1. Upgrade to proftpd 1.1.x (development versions).<br>
        <br>
        2. Have your FTP clients use passive mode. Passive mode
        data connections originate from the client, and thus do
        not experience this &quot;port 20&quot; problem.</td>

        1. Make sure the user/group you specified inside the <a href="reference.html#Anonymous">&lt;Anonymous&gt;</a>
        block actually exists. This must be a real user and
        group, as it is used to control whom the daemon runs as
        and authenticates as.<br>
        <br>
        2. If <a href="reference.html#RequireValidShell">RequireValidShell</a>
        is not specifically turned off, make sure that your
        &quot;ftp user&quot; (as specified by the <a href="reference.html#User">User</a> directive inside an
        &lt;Anonymous&gt; block), has a valid shell listed in
        /etc/shells. If you do not wish to give the user a valid
        shell, you can always use &quot;RequireValidShell
        off&quot; to disable this check.<br>
        <br>
        3. If <a href="reference.html#UseFtpUsers">UseFtpUsers</a>
        is not specifically turned off, make sure that your
        &quot;ftp user&quot; is <strong>not</strong> listed in
        /etc/ftpusers.<br>
        <br>
        If all else fails, you should check your syslog. When
        authentication fails for any reason, proftpd uses the
        syslog mechanism to log the reason for failure; using the
        AUTH (or AUTHPRIV) facility. If you need further
        assistance, you can send email, including related syslog
        entries and your configuration file, to the proftpd
        mailing list at: <a href="mailto:proftpd-l@evcom.net">proftpd-l@evcom.net</a>.</td>

        <td>You should look in the sample-configurations/
        directory from your distribution tarball. Basically,
        you'll need to create another user on your system for the
        guest/anonymous ftp login. For security reasons, it's
        very important that you make sure the user account either
        has a password or has an &quot;unmatchable&quot;
        password. The root directory of the guest/anonymous
        account doesn't have to be the user's directory, but it
        makes sense to do so. After you have created the account,
        put something like the following in your
        /etc/proftpd.conf file (assuming the new user/group name
        is private/private):<br>
        <br>
        &lt;<code>Anonymous ~private&gt;<br>
        AnonRequirePassword off<br>
        User private<br>
        Group private<br>
        RequireValidShell off<br>

        This will allow ftp clients to login to your site with
        the username 'private' and their e-mail address as a
        password. You can change the <a href="reference.html#AnonRequirePassword">AnonRequirePassword</a>
        directive to &quot;on&quot; if you want clients to be
        forced to transmit the correct password for the 'private'
        account. This sample configuration allows clients to
        change into, list and read all directories, but denies
        write access of any kind.</td>

        <td>The &lt;Limit LOGIN&gt; directive is used to control
        connection or login access to a particular context (the
        directive block which contains it). When a client
        initially connects to proftpd, the daemon searches the
        configuration tree for &lt;Limit LOGIN&gt; directives,
        and attached parameters (such as Allow, Deny, etc). If it
        determines that there is no possible way for the client
        to ever be allowed to login, such as a &quot;Deny
        from&quot; matching the client's source address, without
        an overriding &quot;Allow from&quot; at a lower level,
        the client is disconnected without being offered the
        opportunity to transmit a user and password. However, if
        it is possible for the client to be allowed a login,
        proftpd continues as per normal, allowing the client to
        login only if the proper &lt;Limit LOGIN&gt; applies.
        Normally, &lt;Limit&gt; directive blocks are allowed in
        the server config, <a href="reference.html">&lt;VirtualHost&gt;</a>,
        <a href="reference.html#Anonymous">&lt;Anonymous&gt;</a>
        and <a href="reference.html#Directory">&lt;Directory&gt;</a>
        contexts. However, &lt;Limit LOGIN&gt; should not be used
        in a &lt;Directory&gt; context, as clients do not
        connect/login to a directory (and thus it is
        meaningless).<br>
        <br>
        By way of example, the following configuration snippit
        illustrates a &lt;Limit LOGIN&gt; deny which will cause
        any incoming connections from the 10.1.1.x subnet to be
        immediately disconnected, without a welcome message:<br>
        <br>
        <code>...<br>
        &lt;Limit LOGIN&gt;<br>
        Order deny,allow<br>
        Deny from 10.1.1.<br>
        Allow from all<br>
        &lt;/Limit&gt;<br>
        ...</code><br>
        <br>
        Next, an example of a configuration using &lt;Limit
        LOGIN&gt; that will not immediately disconnect an
        incoming client, but will return &quot;Login
        invalid&quot; for all login attempts except anonymous.<br>
        <br>
        <code>...<br>
        &lt;Limit LOGIN&gt;<br>
        DenyAll<br>
        &lt;/Limit&gt;<br>
        &lt;Anonymous ~ftp&gt;<br>
        ...<br>
        &lt;Limit LOGIN&gt;<br>
        AllowAll<br>
        &lt;/Limit&gt;<br>

        <td valign="top">You can use an <a href="reference.html#anonymous">&lt;Anonymous&gt;</a>
        directive context block, possibly in combination with a <a href="reference.html#userpassword">UserPassword</a>/<a href="reference.html#anonrequirepassword">AnonRequirePassword</a>
        directive. If you wish to jail an entire group (or
        groups) of users, you can use the <a href="reference.html#defaultroot">DefaultRoot</a>
        directive (<strong>available only in 0.99.0pl7 and above</strong>).
        DefaultRoot lets you specify a root jailed directory (or
        '~' for the user's home directory), and an optional
        group-expression argument which can be used to control
        which groups of users the jail will be applied to. For
        example:<br>
        <br>
        <code>...<br>
        &lt;VirtualHost myhost.mynet.foo&gt;<br>
        DefaultRoot ~<br>
        ...<br>
        &lt;/VirtualHost&gt;</code><br>
        <br>
        This creates a configuration where all users who log into
        myhost.mynet.foo are jailed into their home directories
        (cannot chdir into a higher level directory).
        Alternatively, you could:<br>
        <br>
        <code>...<br>
        &lt;VirtualHost myhost.mynet.foo&gt;<br>
        DefaultRoot /u2/public users,!staff<br>
        ...<br>
        &lt;/VirtualHost&gt;</code><br>
        <br>
        In this sample, all users who are members of group
        'users', but not members of group 'staff' are jailed into
        /u2/public. If a user does not meet the group-expression
        requirements, they login as per normal (not jailed,
        default directory is their home).<br>
        <br>
        You can use multiple DefaultRoot directives to create
        multiple jails inside the same directive context. If two
        DefaultRoot directives apply to the same user, proftpd
        arbitrarily chooses one (based on how the configuration
        file was parsed).</td>

        <td>There are two methods of accomplishing this (possibly
        more). First, you can create a directory structure inside
        your anonymous FTP root directory, creating a single
        directory for each user and setting ownership/permissions
        as appropriate. Then, either create a symlink from each
        user's home directory into the FTP site, or instruct your
        users on how to access their directory.<p>The alternate
        method (and more versatile) of accomplishing per-user
        anonymous FTP is to use <a href="reference.html#AnonymousGroup">AnonymousGroup</a>
        in combination with the <a href="reference.html#DefaultRoot">DefaultRoot</a>
        directory. You'll probably want to do this inside a <a href="reference.html#VirtualHost">&lt;VirtualHost&gt;</a>,
        otherwise none of your users will be able to access your
        system without being stuck inside their per-user FTP
        site. Additionally, you'll want to use a defered <a href="reference.html#Directory">&lt;Directory&gt;</a>
        block to carefully limit outside access to each user's
        site.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Create a new unix group on
        your system named `anonftp'. Please each user who will
        have per-user anonymous FTP in this group.<br>
        <strong>Step 2:</strong> Create an `anon-ftp' and
        `anon-ftp/incoming' directory in each user's home
        directory.<br>
        <strong>Step 3:</strong> Modify your /etc/proftpd.conf
        file to look something like this (you'll probably want to
        customize this to your needs):</p>
