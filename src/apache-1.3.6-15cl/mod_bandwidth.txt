 Server configuration directive :
 --------------------------------

 -  BandWidthModule 
    Syntax  : BandWidthModule <On|Off>
    Default : Off
    Context : per server config

    Enable or disable totaly the whole module. By default, the module is
    disable so it is safe to compile it in the server anyway.

 Directory / Server / Virtual Server configuration directive :
 -------------------------------------------------------------

 -  BandWidth
    Syntax  : BandWidth <domain|ip|all> <rate>
    Default : none
    Context : per directory, .htaccess

    Limit the bandwidth for files in this directory and
    sub-directories based on the remote host <domain> or
    <ip> address or for <all> remote hosts.

    The <rate> is in Bytes/second.
    A <rate> of "0" means no bandwidth limit.

    Several BandWidth limits can be set for the same
    directory to set different limits for different
    hosts. In this case, the order of the "BandWidth"
    keywords is important as the module will take the
    first entry which matches the client address.

    Example :
       <Directory /home/www>
       BandWidth ecp.fr 0
       BandWidth 138.195 0
       BandWidth all 1024
       </Directory>

      This will limit the bandwith for directory /home/www and 
      all it's subdirectories to 1024Bytes/sec, except for 
      *.ecp.fr or 138.195.*.* where no limit is set.

 -  LargeFileLimit
    Syntax  : LargeFileLimit <filesize> <rate>
    Default : none
    Context : per directory, .htaccess

    Set a maximal <rate> (in bytes/sec) to use when transfering
    a file of <filesize> KBytes or more.

    Several "LargeFileLimit" can be set for various files sizes
    to create range. The rate used for a given file size will be
    the one of the matching range.

    A <rate> of "0" mean that there isn't any limit based on
    the size.

    A <rate> of "-1" mean that there isn't any limit for that type
    of file. It's override even a BandWidth limit. I found this usefull
    to give priority to very small files (html pages, very small pictures)
    while seting limits for larger files... (users with their video files
    can go to hell ! :)

    Example :
    If the following limits are set :
       LargeFileLimit 200 3072
       LargeFileLimit 1024 2048

       That's mean that a file of less than 200KBytes won't be
       limited based on his size. A file with a size between
       200KBytes (included) and 1023Kbytes (included) will be
       limited to 3072Bytes/sec and a file of 1024Kbytes or more
       will be limited to 2048Bytes/sec.

 -  MinBandWidth
    Syntax  : MinBandWidth <domain|ip|all> <rate>
    Default : all 256
    Context : per directory, .htaccess

    Set a minimal bandwidth to use for transfering data. This
    over-ride both BandWidth and LargeFileLimit rules as well
    as the calculated rate based on the number of connections.

    The first argument is used in the same way as the first
    argument of BandWidth.

    <rate> is in bytes per second.

    A rate of "0" explicitly means to use the default minimal
    value (256 KBytes/sec).

    A rate of "-1" means that the minimal rate is equal to the
    actual rate defined by BandWidth and LargeFileLimit.
    In fact, that means that the final rate won't depend
    of the number of connections but only on what was defined.

    Example :
    If BandWidth is set to "3072" (3KBytes/sec) and MinBandWidth
    is set to "1024" (1KBytes/sec) that means :
       - if there is one connection, the file will be transfered
         at 3072 Bytes/sec.
       - if there is two connections, each files will be transfered
         at 1536 Bytes/sec. 
       - if there is three or more connections, each files will be
         transfered at 1024 Bytes/sec. (Minimal of 1024 Bytes/sec).

    If MinBandWidth is set to "-1" that means :
       - if there is one connection, the file will be transfered
         at 3072 Bytes/sec.
       - if there is two or more connections, each files will be
         transfered at 3072 Bytes/sec. In effect, the rate doesn't
         depend anymore on the number of connections but only on
         the configuration values.

    Note that the total transfer rate will never exceed your physical
    bandwidth limitation.

 Note : If both a "BandWidth" and a "LargeFileLimit" limit apply,
        the lowest one will be used. (But never lower than the
        "MinBandWidth" rate)

        If both a virtual server limit is defined and another
        apply for a directory under this virtual server, the
        directory limit will over-ride it.

        If a limit is defined outside a Directory or VirtualHost
        directive, it will act as default on a per virtual server
        basis. (Ie: each virtual server will have that limit,
        _independantly_ of the other servers)
