+is provided to allow shell scripts to safely use temporary files.
+Traditionally, many shell scripts take the name of the program with
+the PID as a suffix and use that as a temporary file name.  This
+kind of naming scheme is predictable and the race condition it creates
+is easy for an attacker to win.  A safer, though still inferior approach
+is to make a temporary directory using the same naming scheme.  While
+this does allow one to guarantee that a temporary file will not be
+subverted, it still allows a simple denial of service attack.  For these
